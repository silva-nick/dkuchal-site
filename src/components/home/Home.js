              There are 30 tasks in total and all the tasks will be posted on
              this website and through emails. Only tasks for the current week
              (1, 2, or 3) will be available at any given time. Each task will
              have a detailed instruction file (.docx/ .pdf) that will be
              accessible through the website or through a backup Box folder in
              case of outages.

            26-30, you will be able to complete the tasks that you have not
            finished in the previous 4 weeks.{" "}

            <p style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Scoring</p>
            Your team will get points once you submit the evidence on the
            website. You can only earn points once for each task. Solid evidence
            (e.g. photo, video, being present until the end of online
            activities) is required to submit in order to verify the completion.
            For online workshop, you need to be present the whole time to get
            the points. Our admin team will track your attendance at the end of
            each activity. For off-line activities, you need to upload the
            evidence on our website. If only one of you complete the task and
            upload the evidence, you pair will get 50% points for that task. But
            we strongly encourage you to complete these challenges together to
            improve mutual understanding and provide mutual support.
